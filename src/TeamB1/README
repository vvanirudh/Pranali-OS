Q) What we have done?
A) 	1. We have added the I/O interrupt capability. 
	2. We are able to block the process when I/O starts.
	But, we have not tested if the code is working.
	
	Implementation details:
	1. Created a struct for interrupts called interrupt_t.
	2. Created a struct for disk condition called disk_t.
	3. Changed the status of the program to blocked in the system call handler for read/write system calls.
